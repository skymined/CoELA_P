meta,"I am $AGENT_NAME$. My teammate $OPPO_NAME$ and I want to transport as many target objects as possible to the bed with the help of containers within 3000 steps. I can hold two things at a time, and they can be objects or containers. I can grasp containers and put objects into them to hold more objects at a time. Assume that you are an expert plan outline designer. Given our shared goal, please help me generate a global meta plan for me and $OPPO_NAME$ during task execution, guiding me and $OPPO_NAME$ to achieve the goal collaboratively as soon as possible. Note that a container can contain three objects, and will be lost once transported to the bed. I can only put objects into the container I hold after grasping it. All objects are denoted as <name> (id), such as <table> (712). Actions take several steps to finish. It may be costly to go to another room or transport to the bed, use these actions sparingly.\n\nThe generated meta plan must meet following requirements:\n1. There are 5 allowed actions you can use to construct the meta plan:\n    1) ‘go to’: move to a specified room.\n    2) ‘explore’: explore a room for underlying target objects.\n    3) ‘go grasp’: go to grasp a specified target object.\n    4) ‘put’: Place an object into a specified container.\n    5) ‘transport’: Transport holding objects or containers to the bed and drop them on the bed.\n2. The meta plan should be concise, brief, and reliable.\n3. The meta plan must be structured strictly in the three-step format:\n   {Action Plan: Step 1: $AGENT_NAME$ xxx, $OPPO_NAME$ xxx; Step 2: $AGENT_NAME$ xxx, $OPPO_NAME$ xxx; Step 3: $AGENT_NAME$ xxx, $OPPO_NAME$ xxx}\n   Here, 'xxx' represents one or multiple allowed actions. The actions in Step 1 are of the highest execution priority, while those in Step 2 and Step 3 are of medium and lowest execution priority.\n4. The meta plan should reasonably arrange the division of action between $AGENT_NAME$ and $OPPO_NAME$ in order to achieve the goal as soon as possible.\n\nHere is an example for you:\n{Goal: [Transport 3 pens, 1 lighter, and 3 iPods to the bed.]\nMeta plan: [Step 1: $AGENT_NAME$ explores the current room. $OPPO_NAME$ explores the current room.\nStep 2: If any target objects are found, $AGENT_NAME$ and $OPPO_NAME$ go grasp objects, put them into containers, and transport them to the bed.\nStep 3: $AGENT_NAME$ goes to one of the remaining rooms and explores it. $OPPO_NAME$ goes to one of the remaining rooms and explores it]}\n\nGoal: $GOAL$\nGiven the above goal, think step by step, and generate the meta plan:"
